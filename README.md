# Kubernetes Starter: Ingress + Probes + Autoscaling

A beginner-friendly project for learning Kubernetes the **practical way**.  
We’ll deploy a small **FastAPI “Hello World” app** on minikube with Ingress, health probes, resource limits, and autoscaling.

---

## 🚀 What this is

A minimal, production-minded Kubernetes deployment of a single service with:

- **Ingress (NGINX)** – route external traffic to the app  
- **Readiness/Liveness probes** – so Kubernetes knows when pods are healthy  
- **Resource requests/limits** – CPU & memory constraints for predictable scheduling  
- **HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)** – auto-scale pods up/down based on CPU  
- **ConfigMap & Secret examples** – inject config and secrets without rebuilding images  

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)  
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)  
- (Optional) [`hey`](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) or [`ab`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) for load testing

## 🏃 Quick start

Want to see the finished project right away?  
Check out the final code and run it locally:

    git checkout main        # final version of the project
    make dev-up              # builds image, starts minikube, applies manifests
    make test-load           # runs load to trigger HPA
    make status              # shows pods, svc, hpa
    make down                # cleanup

Once deployed, open:

- App: https://hello.local  
- FastAPI Docs: https://hello.local/docs  
- ReDoc: https://hello.local/redoc

## 🌿 Tutorial Tags

This repo has multiple ways to follow along:

- **`start` branch** → clean slate to begin the tutorial from scratch  
- **`main` branch** → finished project with all steps completed  
- **step-XX tags** → optional shortcuts to jump to specific milestones  

Tags (optional jump points):  
- `step-02-app-container` → FastAPI app + Dockerfile  
- `step-03-k8s-deploy` → namespace, deployment, service  
- `step-04-configmap-secret` → environment variables & secrets  
- `step-05-ingress-tls` → ingress with TLS  
- `step-06-hpa-scaling` → autoscaling with HPA  
- `step-07-security-basics` → pod/container hardening  

👉 By default, check out the `start` branch and follow the docs step by step.  
👉 Use tags only if you want to **jump ahead** or **catch up** at a given step.
